# Smart_Wood_Burner
Welcome to the Smart Wood Burner project! 

Our mission is to tackle energy challenges in Sri Lanka with innovative solutions. The Smart Wood Burner is a testament to our commitment to making a positive impact.

**Efficiency Meets Sustainability:** The heart of this project lies in its ability to make wood burning for cooking smarter and more efficient. We've developed an automated fan system that adapts to the intensity of the fire, ensuring optimal fuel consumption. This not only saves resources but also reduces harmful emissions.

**A Greener Tomorrow:** Sustainability is at the core of our project. By intelligently managing combustion, the Smart Wood Burner contributes to a cleaner environment. It's not just about cooking; it's about cooking responsibly.

Join us on this journey towards a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly future. Together, we can make a difference, one wood burner at a time. üåøüåç
